# Design

## Problem

Specs and code drift apart. Documentation describes intent, code implements it, and over time the two diverge silently. In agent-driven workflows this is acute: agents change code without updating specs, and stale specs produce stale prompts that produce wrong code.

## Solution

drift makes the anchor between specs and code explicit and enforceable. Any markdown file can declare which code it governs. When that code changes, `drift lint` flags the spec as stale. The lint runs as a CI gate or pre-commit hook — agents that change code must update the specs they affect.

## Data Model

### Spec

A spec is any markdown file with a `drift:` key in its YAML frontmatter. Specs can live anywhere in the repo. drift discovers them by scanning for the frontmatter marker.

```markdown
---
drift:
  files:
    - src/auth/login.ts@qpvuntsm
    - src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig@qpvuntsm
---

# Auth Architecture

The login flow uses @./src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig@qpvuntsm for token validation.

<!-- depends: docs/project.md -->
```

### Anchors

An anchor is a declared relationship between a spec and a code artifact. Two sources:

**Explicit anchors** — listed in `drift.files` frontmatter. Can be file-level (`src/auth/login.ts`) or symbol-level (`src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig`).

**Implicit anchors** — `@./path` and `@./path#Symbol` references in the spec body. Parsed from content, treated identically to explicit anchors for staleness detection.

Each anchor can optionally carry provenance — a VCS reference (git SHA or jj change ID) recording which change last addressed this anchor. The syntax is `path@change`:

- `src/auth/login.ts` — bound file, no provenance yet
- `src/auth/login.ts@qpvuntsm` — bound file with provenance at change qpvuntsm
- `src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig@qpvuntsm` — symbol anchor with provenance
- In inline references: `@./src/auth/login.ts@qpvuntsm`

The `@change` suffix is optional. Bare paths still work. Different anchors can have different provenance since each file tracks its own change independently. There is no separate `changes:` list.

In jj, change IDs are stable across rewrites. In git, SHAs may become unreachable after rebase, but staleness detection is VCS-history-based, not SHA-based, so this doesn't affect correctness.

### Symbol-Level Anchors

An anchor like `src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig` resolves to a specific AST symbol rather than the whole file. drift parses the file with tree-sitter, finds the symbol's declaration, and hashes a normalized representation of that subtree. Changes elsewhere in the file don't trigger staleness, and formatting-only changes inside the symbol are ignored.

Resolution uses tree-sitter `.scm` queries per language. A simple query finds named declarations:

```scheme
[
  (function_declaration name: (identifier) @name)
  (class_declaration name: (type_identifier) @name)
  (type_alias_declaration name: (type_identifier) @name)
  (interface_declaration name: (type_identifier) @name)
  (lexical_declaration (variable_declarator name: (identifier) @name))
] @definition
```

Filter captures where `@name` matches the target symbol. Extract the `@definition` subtree and hash a normalized traversal of it (node kinds, structure, and token text; no layout/position data).

If the symbol is not found, the anchor is reported as STALE with reason "symbol not found".

### Dependencies

Specs can depend on other specs via `<!-- depends: path/to/other.md -->` comments. This declares that one spec builds on another's context. Dependencies are used for DAG ordering when composing prompts (future), not for staleness detection.

## Staleness Detection

For each spec, drift determines staleness by comparing VCS history. Provenance is per-anchor: each anchor's `@change` suffix records the last change where that anchor was addressed.

1. For each anchor, determine its baseline — the anchor's provenance change if present, otherwise the last commit that modified the spec file
2. Check the anchor against its baseline:
   - **File-level**: for supported tree-sitter languages, parse the file and hash a normalized syntax fingerprint of the file; otherwise compare raw file content
   - **Symbol-level**: parse the file, hash a normalized syntax fingerprint of the symbol, compare against the fingerprint at the baseline
3. If any anchor has changed after its baseline, the spec is stale

The baseline lookup is:
```
git show <baseline>:<bound-file>
```

In jj:
```
jj file show -r <baseline> <bound-file>
```

Because provenance is per-anchor, updating one anchor's change reference doesn't affect staleness detection for other anchors in the same spec. A spec with three anchors can have two fresh and one stale.

### Blame Enrichment

When a spec is stale, the lint output includes who changed the bound code:

```
docs/auth.md
  STALE  src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig
         changed by mike in e4f8a2c (Mar 15)
         "refactor: split auth config into separate concerns"
```

This is a free byproduct of the VCS query — `git log` gives author and message.

### Missing Anchors

If a file anchor can't be resolved (file doesn't exist), it's reported as STALE with reason "file not found":

```
docs/auth.md
  STALE   src/core/old-module.ts
          file not found
```

If a symbol anchor can't be resolved (symbol not found in file), it's reported as STALE with reason "symbol not found":

```
docs/auth.md
  STALE   src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig
          symbol not found
```

Additional modules:
- `frontmatter.zig` — YAML frontmatter parsing and editing
- `main.zig` — CLI entry point, command dispatch, report formatting

### scanner.zig

Walks the repo looking for markdown files with `drift:` frontmatter. Parses frontmatter to extract explicit anchors. Parses content to extract implicit anchors (`@` references). No index — scans on every run. Performance is bounded by the number of markdown files, not the size of the codebase.

### symbols.zig

For each anchor, resolves the current state:

- **File-level**: stat the file, hash its content
- **Symbol-level**: parse with tree-sitter, find the symbol via `.scm` query, hash a normalized syntax fingerprint of the symbol

Parsing is on-demand. Only files that are actually bound get parsed. A lint run that checks 10 specs anchoring to 30 symbols across 20 files does 20 tree-sitter parses — milliseconds.

### vcs.zig

Shells out to git or jj. Auto-detected from `.jj` (preferred) or `.git` directory. Operations:

- `log`: find commits that modified a file after a given point
- `blame`: get author/message for a commit
- `rev-parse` / equivalent: resolve refs

No libgit2, no jj library. Subprocess cost is negligible for the number of queries drift makes.

## On-Disk Format

drift requires minimal on-disk state:

```
.drift/
  config.yaml       # optional project-level settings
```

Specs live anywhere in the repo — they're just markdown files. The `.drift/` directory exists only for optional configuration (scan globs, VCS backend override, etc.).

```yaml
# .drift/config.yaml (optional)
scan:
  include:
    - "docs/**/*.md"
    - "*.md"
  exclude:
    - "node_modules/**"
    - "vendor/**"
vcs: auto    # auto | git | jj
```

If no config exists, drift scans all `*.md` and `**/*.md` files and auto-detects the VCS.
