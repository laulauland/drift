# drift

Bind specs to code. Lint for drift.

Any markdown file in your repo can declare anchors to code — specific files or AST symbols. When bound code changes, `drift lint` flags the spec as stale. Agents that change code must update the specs they affect.

## Install

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe --prefix ~/.local
```

## Quickstart with Claude Code

Install the CLI and the agent skill:

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe --prefix ~/.local
npx skills add fiberplane/drift
```

The skill teaches Claude Code how to maintain drift anchors — when to link, when to update specs, and how to handle stale anchors. Once installed, you can tell Claude to add drift to your existing docs:

> "Add drift anchors to docs/auth.md for src/auth/login.ts and src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig"

> "Run drift lint and fix any stale specs"

> "Write a spec for the payment module and bind it to the relevant source files"

Claude will run `drift link` to stamp provenance and keep specs in sync as it makes code changes. When drift lint is in CI, stale specs block merges — so the agent can't silently break documentation.

## Usage

Write a markdown spec, then bind it to code:

```
drift link docs/auth.md src/auth/login.ts
drift link docs/auth.md src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig
```

`drift link` adds the anchor to the spec's YAML frontmatter and auto-appends provenance (current git HEAD). You can also reference code inline — `@./src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig` in the spec body — and `drift link` will stamp those with provenance too.

Check if specs are fresh:

```
drift lint
```

Refresh all anchors in a spec after updating it:

```
drift link docs/auth.md
```

### What a spec looks like

After linking, your spec has frontmatter anchors and (optionally) inline references:

```markdown
---
drift:
  files:
    - src/auth/login.ts@a1b2c3d
    - src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig@a1b2c3d
---

# Auth Architecture

Users authenticate via OAuth2. The validation flow uses @./src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig@a1b2c3d ...
```

Each anchor carries provenance via an `@change` suffix — a snapshot of which VCS change you last reviewed that file at. Provenance is per-anchor, so different files track independently.

If you don't want frontmatter visible in render frontends like GitHub, wrap it in an HTML comment instead — drift picks it up the same way:

```markdown
<!-- drift:
  files:
    - src/auth/login.ts@a1b2c3d
    - src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig@a1b2c3d
-->
```

## Commands

```
drift lint          Check all specs for staleness (exits 1 if stale)
drift status        Show all specs and their anchors
drift link          Add an anchor to a spec (auto-appends provenance)
drift unlink        Remove an anchor from a spec
```

## How staleness works

For each anchor with provenance, drift compares the bound code at the provenance revision against its current state. For supported tree-sitter languages, both file anchors and symbol anchors compare normalized syntax fingerprints that ignore formatting-only changes. Unsupported files fall back to raw content comparison. If the bound code differs, the spec is stale. This is content-based — git rebases that don't change content won't trigger false positives, and jj rewrites that do change content won't slip through.

For symbol-level anchors (`#AuthConfig`), drift parses the file with tree-sitter and compares a normalized fingerprint of just that symbol's AST node. Formatting-only changes inside the symbol don't trigger staleness; syntax/token changes do.

Staleness is reported with a reason:

```
$ drift lint

docs/auth.md
  STALE   src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig
          changed after spec
  STALE   src/core/old-module.ts
          file not found

docs/payments.md
  ok

1 spec stale, 1 ok
```

Reasons include:
- **changed after spec** — the bound file (or symbol) was modified after the spec
- **file not found** — the bound file no longer exists
- **symbol not found** — the bound symbol no longer exists in the file

## CI

`drift lint` exits 1 when any spec is stale, so it works as a CI gate:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/drift.yml
name: Drift
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: fiberplane/drift@main
      - run: drift lint
```

`fetch-depth: 0` is required — drift needs VCS history to compare content at provenance revisions. The setup action auto-detects platform and downloads the right binary from GitHub releases.

## VCS support

git. jj support is planned for when jj-native forges exist — until then, colocated jj repos use git provenance, which works in both local and CI environments.

## Development

Requires Zig 0.15.2. The repo includes a `.tool-versions` file for [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (or asdf). If you haven't already, [activate mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#activate-mise) in your shell, then:

```bash
mise install        # installs zig 0.15.2
zig build test      # run tests
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe  # build release binary
```

Enable the pre-push hook to run build, lint, and tests before every push:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```
