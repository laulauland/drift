Bind specs to code and check for drift.

Any markdown file in your repo can declare anchors to code — specific files or AST symbols. When bound code changes, `drift check` flags the spec as stale. Agents that change code must update the specs they affect.

## Install

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install fiberplane/tap/drift
```

### Shell installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://drift.fp.dev/install.sh | sh
```

To install a specific version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://drift.fp.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- --version vX.Y.Z
```

Or build from source:

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe --prefix ~/.local
```

### Coding agent skill (Claude Code, Codex)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://drift.fp.dev/install.sh | sh
npx skills add fiberplane/drift
```

The skill teaches coding agents how to maintain drift anchors. Once installed, the agent will run `drift link` to stamp provenance and keep specs in sync as it makes code changes. When `drift check` is in CI, stale specs block merges — so the agent can't silently break documentation.

## Usage

Write a markdown spec, then bind it to code:

```
drift link docs/auth.md src/auth/login.ts
drift link docs/auth.md src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig
```

`drift link` adds the anchor to the spec's YAML frontmatter and stamps a content signature — an AST fingerprint of the target file or symbol. No git commit needed; it hashes what's on disk. You can also reference code inline — `@./src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig` in the spec body — and `drift link` will stamp those too.

Check if specs are fresh:

```
drift check
```

Refresh all anchors in a spec after updating it:

```
drift link docs/auth.md
```

### What a spec anchor looks like

After linking, your spec has frontmatter anchors and (optionally) inline references:

```markdown
---
drift:
  files:
    - src/auth/login.ts@sig:e4f8a2c10b3d7890
    - src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig@sig:1a2b3c4d5e6f7890
---

# Auth Architecture

Users authenticate via OAuth2. The validation flow uses @./src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig@sig:1a2b3c4d5e6f7890 ...
```

Every anchor has three parts:

```
src/auth/provider.ts   #AuthConfig   @sig:1a2b3c4d5e6f7890
└── file path ──────┘  └─ symbol ─┘  └──── signature ─────┘
```

- **Path** — the file you're binding to, relative to the repo root.
- **Symbol** — optional `#Name` suffix that narrows the anchor to a specific declaration (function, class, type). Only changes to that symbol trigger staleness.
- **Signature** — content fingerprint stamped by `drift link`. An XxHash3 hash of the file or symbol's normalized AST, so staleness detection doesn't depend on VCS history. Rebasing, amending, or linking uncommitted files all work. Per-anchor, so different files track independently.

If you don't want frontmatter visible on GitHub, use an HTML comment instead:

```markdown
<!-- drift:
  files:
    - src/auth/login.ts@sig:e4f8a2c10b3d7890
    - src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig@sig:1a2b3c4d5e6f7890
-->
```

### Cross-repo specs (origin)

Specs that travel across repo boundaries — installed skills, vendored docs, shared templates — can declare where their anchors belong:

```yaml
drift:
  origin: github:fiberplane/drift
  files:
    - src/main.zig@sig:a1b2c3d4e5f67890
```

When `origin` is set and doesn't match the current repo, `drift check` skips those anchors instead of reporting false "file not found" errors. Specs without `origin` are always checked.

## Commands

```
drift check         Check all specs for staleness (exits 1 if stale)
drift status        Show all spec anchors, including inline @./ refs
drift link          Add an anchor to a spec (auto-appends provenance)
drift unlink        Remove an anchor from frontmatter or drift comments
```

`drift lint` is an alias for `drift check`.

## How staleness works

Each anchor's `@sig:` records a fingerprint of the code at the time it was linked. `drift check` recomputes the fingerprint from the current file and compares. For supported languages (TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Zig, Java), comparison is syntax-aware — drift parses with tree-sitter and hashes a normalized AST fingerprint (node kinds + token text, no whitespace or position data). Reformatting won't trigger false positives. Symbol-level anchors (`#AuthConfig`) narrow this to just that declaration's subtree. Unsupported languages fall back to raw content comparison.

No VCS history is needed for staleness detection — `drift check` works entirely from the stored signature and current file content.

```
$ drift check

docs/auth.md
  STALE   src/auth/provider.ts#AuthConfig (changed after spec)
          changed by mike in e4f8a2c (Mar 15)
          "refactor: split auth config into separate concerns"
  STALE   src/core/old-module.ts (file not found)
  ok      src/auth/login.ts

docs/payments.md
  ok

1 spec stale, 1 ok
```

## CI

`drift check` exits 1 when any spec is stale, so it works as a CI gate:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/drift.yml
name: Drift
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: fiberplane/drift@main
      - run: drift check
```

`fetch-depth: 0` is recommended — drift uses VCS history for blame info on stale anchors and for legacy `@<git-sha>` provenance. With `@sig:` provenance (the default), staleness detection itself doesn't need history. The setup action auto-detects platform, downloads the right binary from GitHub releases, and verifies its checksum before installing.

## Development

Requires Zig 0.15.2. The repo includes a `.tool-versions` file for [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (or asdf). If you haven't already, [activate mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#activate-mise) in your shell, then:

```bash
mise install        # installs zig 0.15.2
zig build test      # run tests
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe  # build release binary
```

Enable the pre-push hook to run build, lint, and tests before every push:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```
